### Reference Solution ###

function data = stock_check(symbol)
% Help: stock_check('AAPL') returns relevant stock data about Apple.

% Markit Quote Endpoint
endpoint = 'http://dev.markitondemand.com/MODApis/Api/v2/Quote/json';

% Webread makes an HTTP GET request to Markit's Quote endpoint.
% webread(endpoint, key, value)

% The request parameter for this API call is just the symbol, these
% are in the form of 'key-value' pairs. Here the key is 'symbol' and the value
% is a stock symbol (i.e. AAPL).

resp = webread(endpoint, 'symbol', symbol);

% Run this code in MATLAB to determine the output of the API. It should
% return a data structure you are familiar with. Using the data structure,
% figure out how to extract the stock name, symbol, last price, change percent, and timestamp:

data = {resp.Name, resp.Symbol, resp.LastPrice, resp.ChangePercent, resp.Timestamp};

end

### Hidden Tests ###

%%

goog_sign = 'GOOGL';
goog = stock_check(goog_sign);

% test that the output is a cell array
assert(iscell(goog), 'Your function should return a cell array')
assert(~isequal(goog{2}, 'GOOG'), 'There was an error in your cell array return.')
assert(length(goog) == 5, 'Your function should output a cell array with 5 elements.')
assert(ischar(goog{1}), 'The first element of your output should be the name of the stock, as a string.')
assert(ischar(goog{2}), 'The second element of your output should be the stock symbol, as a string.')
assert(isnumeric(goog{3}), 'The third element of your output should be the last stock price, as a double.')
assert(isnumeric(goog{4}), 'The fourth element of your output should be the stock''s change in percentage, as a double.')
assert(ischar(goog{5}), 'The fifth element of your output should be the timestamp, as a string.')
