%Attempt at making something by Grace lol maybe we can make this a nice simple cody for OOP?

%Create a class 'Date' that has three properties: month (a string), day and
%year (positive integers). Overload the disp to print the date in the
%format as follows:
 
%today=Date('April',20,2017)
%The date is April 20, 2017.
 


%Create your Date class below!
classdef Date
    properties
        month
        day
        year
    end
    methods
        function obj=Date(month,day,year)
            obj.month=month;
            obj.day=day;
            obj.year=year;
        end
        function disp(obj)
            fprintf('The date is %s %d, %d.\n',obj.month,obj.day,obj.year)
        end
    end
end
