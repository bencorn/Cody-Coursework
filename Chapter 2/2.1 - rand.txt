### REFERENCE SOLUTION ###

% generate a 4x5 matrix with  real numbers between 5 and 10
mat = rand(4,5) * 5 + 5;

### HIDDEN TESTS ###

%%
run('solution')

% check for variable existence
vars = whos;
is_mat = any(strcmp('mat', {vars.name}));
assert(is_mat, 'Make sure you define a variable with the name "mat"')

% check for the correct dimensions
[foo, bar] = size(mat);
assert(foo == 4, 'Your matrix should be 4x5. Make sure your matrix has 4 rows.')
assert(bar == 5, 'Your matrix should be 4x5. Make sure your matrix has 5 columns.')

% check for real numbers
intmat = round(mat);
assert(all(all(intmat ~= mat)), 'Your matrix should contain REAL numbers (not integers).')

% check for the correct range
assert(all(all(mat > 5)), 'Your matrix contains one or more real numbers less than 5. Your matrix should contain only real numbers between 5 and 10.')
assert(all(all(mat < 10)), 'Your matrix contains one or more real numbers greater than 10. Your matrix should contain only real numbers between 5 and 10.')

% check for assignment suppression
code = fileread('solution.m');
scolons = strfind(code, ';');
assert(numel(scolons) >= 1, 'Make sure to suppress your variable assignment with a semicolon. For example: mat = 4;')
